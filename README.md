## 1. **Project Overview**

### 1.1 **About the Project**
**Healthy-Life Blog** is my Code Institute Project 4, designed to empower individuals to lead healthier lives by providing informative blogs, expert advice, and fostering a supportive online community. Users can explore content on various health topics, engage with posts by liking and commenting, but are not allowed to create their own blog posts. This platform strives to inspire individuals to take better care of their well-being.

### 1.2 **Learning Experience**
This project has been a great opportunity to dive deep into full-stack development. I am grateful to Code Institute for their exceptional Learning Management System (LMS) that has significantly contributed to my development skills. Special thanks go to the mentor service and student support team for their continuous guidance and encouragement.
